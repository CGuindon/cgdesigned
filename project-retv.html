          <h1>Re-Imagine TV</h1>
          <p>
            The R&D department at Turner Broadcasting System Inc. came to You.i
            TV with a goal. &ldquo;To reimagine the traditional user experience
            for video consumption. What if...&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            We designed and built a demo app for exploration and
            experimentation. This would be a playground for innovation,
            funneling ideas and features into production apps for their network
            brands such as: TNT, TBS, NBA, Cartoon Network, Bleacher Report and
            TruTV.

            Not only does watching in real-time avoid spoilers, live TV has
            become a real-time social event that goes way beyond the confines of
            our living rooms.

            Choices are more personal because it’s not dictated by schedule and

          Using data and analytics we received from their research and marketing
          teams, a few personas were created to represent our target audience.
          Each persona had their own set of preferences and reasons for watching
          TV, covering all the most common uses cases found in the research.

          Before starting to talk about solutions, I created three guiding
          principles that we could refer back to for the full duration of the
          project life cycle. This would help remind the team what we were
          trying to achieve holistically.

          Initial Concept
        </h2>
        <p>
          We chose to push on personalization and base the core experience on
          adaptable content structures. The top content for a user would be
          chosen based on habits, behaviour patterns and preferences, while also
          making new content discoverable. I built a clickable prototype that
          would allow us to do some initial user testing and give the client a
          feel for the main interaction and flow. This allowed us to get more
          concrete feedback early on and adapt our the skeleton and base frame
          of the app quickly and easily.

          Imagery
        </h2>
        <p>
          The research indicated that looking at images not only prompted users
          to watch content, but accounted most of their time spent browsing (as
          opposed to, say, reading movie titles or descriptions). I chose to use
          big and bold imagery to represent the content; emphasizing items in
          focus with large full scale background images.

          Themes
        </h2>
        <p>
          The goal was to minimize a user’s chances of getting choice paralysis
          when browsing and to remove the barrier between linear (Live) and
          non-linear (video-on-demand) content. The main lander shows a mixed
          collection of videos, organized into sets of playlists. Each playlist
          has a common theme and surfaces both Live and VOD content. Users can
          navigate horizontally to stay within a theme or scroll vertically to
          change the theme. The idea was to use one axis to find similar or
          related content and to use the opposite axis to find content that was
          completely different;

          <h2>My List</h2>
          <p>
            The common watchlist feature was improved with two primary
            objectives. First, the time users spent looking for their favourite
            shows every week needed to be reduced. Second, the number of
            interactions and cognitive load required to jump from one show to
            another needed to be minimized. I took the concept of playlists from
            the music industry and blended that with a traditional watchlist or
            PVR functionality. The mashup became a new kind of system for
            favouring — My List. Users can choose to subscribe to a Television
            series; all new episodes will automatically be added to their My
            List. They can also choose to save individual episodes or movies for
            later. All of these items are combined into a single smart playlist
            that gives me a mixed customized set of episodes from all my
            favourite shows.

        <h2>End Transition</h2>
        <p>
          I needed to support binge-watching, but also allow users to seamlessly
          switch from one series to another. At the end of a video, we
          automatically begin playing another video based on the most logical
          choice; for example, playing the following episode of a series.
          However, we also surface 2 other options — the first would surface
          related content (similar genre, actor or other factors) and the second
          would surface content that was completely different. Depending on the
          theme or playlist the user is watching, the end transition options
          adapt to display the most likely options a user would want.
