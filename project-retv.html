          <h1>Re-Imagine TV</h1>
          <p>
            The R&D department at Turner Broadcasting System Inc. came to You.i
            TV with a goal. “To reimagine the traditional user experience for
            video consumption. What if... “
          </p>
          <p>
            We designed and built a demo app for exploration and
            experimentation. This would be a playground for innovation,
            funnelling ideas and features into production apps for their network
            brands such as: TNT, TBS, NBA, Cartoon Network, Bleacher Report and
            TruTV.

          I led a discovery session and design sprint with the client’s team
          over 3 days to establish the key problems we wanted to solve and to
          define the scope of the project. We arrived with two principal problem
          statements that focused on both the user needs as well as the business
          needs.

        <h2>Requirements and Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          The key business goals were to increase minutes watched, number of
          visits, app stability and paid Game Pass subscriptions (full access to
          their premium content). They had a large amount of free shorter video
          clips and strict limitations with the live content (especially games)
          due to broadcasting rights and locations. The authentication system
          was very complex due to varying methods of login and multiple levels
          of locked content. We had a tight deadline for launch which meant
          keeping development efforts minimal for the first version.

        <h2>Base Foundation</h2>
        <p>
          After running a discovery session and design sprint with the client's
          product team, we decided to make more of their free content available
          to all users. Unauthenticated users, could still access a game's
          highlights along with news about the league or specific team. We
          organized all content (free and premium) into digestible categories
          &mdash; this became the top-level navigation of the app. Each category
          followed the same user flow through 3 key screens and actions: browse
          the menu, watch in the player and discover more in the deep dive.
        </p>

        <p>
          My design process started with high level user flows, before creating
          wireframes for key screens that could be used in an interactive
          prototype for testing. The process was repeated throughout the project
          lifecycle, continuously iterating and improving ideas. Some of my
          initial deliverables were detailed annotated wireframes, clickable
          prototypes, extensive user flow diagrams and button mapping
          specifications.

        <h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>
        <p>
          Our main landing pages displayed a video window that would auto-play
          each section's free content. This combined with the 2 level
          collapsible navigation for quick and simple browsing, allowed users to
          get to the content they wanted faster. We also programmed logic within
          each section to surface the most relevant videos first based on
          location and time of use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without missing a moment, users can discover other related content by
          navigating down from the player controls. When in this deep dive
          screen, the video player shrinks down to the top right corner and a
          live score bar is displayed.

        <h2>Flexible Templates</h2>
        <p>
          The 3 key screens were designed to be re-used for each type of content
          without changing the core interactions or user flows. The base
          foundation remains the same while each individual element may vary in
          design to best suit the content’s needs. We worked closely with the
          development team throughout the entire process, ensuring efficiency
          and quality for the final product.

          <li><strong>Twice</strong> as many users now authenticate.</li>
          <li><strong>65% longer</strong> average time using the app.</li>
          <li><strong>27% higher</strong> video conversion rate.</li>

            Increased Game Pass Landing Page visits and Game Pass minutes
            watched.

        <p>
          We continued to work towards future releases that included
          improvements to the current experience, as well as, new features. One
          of those new features was to introduce sponsorship opportunities
          within the app. Using our current design layout, we selected and
          identified specific components within our design system that could
          dynamically insert advertisements at strategic times. These
          advertisements could be easily updated by the client without extra
          development efforts each time.
