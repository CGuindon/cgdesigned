          <p>
            The R&D department at Turner Broadcasting System Inc. came to You.i
            TV with a goal. “To reimagine the traditional user experience for
            video consumption. What if... “
          </p>
          <p>
            We designed and built a demo app for exploration and
            experimentation. This would be a playground for innovation,
            funnelling ideas and features into production apps for their network
            brands such as: TNT, TBS, NBA, Cartoon Network, Bleacher Report and
            TruTV.

          I led a discovery session and design sprint with the client’s team
          over 3 days to establish the key problems we wanted to solve and to
          define the scope of the project. We arrived with two principal problem
          statements that focused on both the user needs as well as the business
          needs.

            Not only does watching in real-time avoid spoilers, live TV has
            become a real-time social event that goes way beyond the confines of
            our living rooms.

            Choices are more personal because it’s not dictated by schedule and

          Using data and analytics we received from their research and marketing
          teams, a few personas were created to represent our target audience.
          Each persona had their own set of preferences and reasons for watching
          TV, covering all of the most common uses cases found in the research.

          Before starting to talk about solutions, I created three guiding
          principles that we could refer back to for the full duration of the
          project life cycle. This would help remind the team what we we’re
          trying to achieve holistically.

          Initial Concept
        </h2>
        <p>
          We chose to push on personalization and base the core experience on
          adaptable content structures. The top content for a user would be
          chosen based on habits, behaviour patterns and preferences, while also
          making new content discoverable. I built a clickable prototype that
          would allows us to do some initial user testing and give the client a
          feel for the main interaction and flow. This allowed us to get more
          concrete feedback early on and adapt our the skeleton and base frame
          of the app quickly and easily.

          Imagery
        </h2>
        <p>
          The research indicated that looking at images not only prompted users
          to watch content, but accounted most of their time spent browsing (as
          opposed to, say, reading movie titles or descriptions).

          Themes

        <p>
          The goal was to minimize a user’s chances of getting choice paralysis
          when browsing and remove the barrier between linear (Live) and
          non-linear (video-on-demand) content. The main lander showed a mixed
          collection of videos organized into sets of playlists. Each playlist
          surfaced both Live and VOD content and has a common theme. Users can
          navigate horizontally to stay within a theme or scroll vertically to
          browse other themes. The idea was to use one axis for seeing more
          similar content and use the other axis to see content that was
          completely different.

          <h2>My List</h2>
          <p>
            I wanted to reduce the time users spent looking for their favourites
            shows every week and minimize the number of interactions and
            cognitive load required to jump from one show to another. I took the
            concept of playlists from the music industry and blended that with a
            traditional watchlist or PVR functionality into a new kind of system
            for favouriting — My List. Users can choose to subscribe to a
            Television series; all new episodes will automatically be added to
            their watchlist. They can also choose to save individual episodes or
            movies for later. All of these items are combined into a single
            smart playlist.

        <h2>End Transition</h2>
        <p>
          I wanted to support binge watching, but also allow users to seamlessly
          switch from one series to another. At the end of a video, we
          automatically begin playing another video based on the most logical
          choice; for example, playing the following episode of a series.
          However, we also surface 2 other options — the first would being
          related content (similar genre, actor or other factors) and the second
          being a completely different content but chosen based on popularity by
          other users. Depending on the theme or playlist the user is watching,
          the end transition options adapt to display the most likely options a
          user would want.
