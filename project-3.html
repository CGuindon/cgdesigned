			              <h1>The Challenge</h1>
			              <p>MYC original website was strictly informative, giving users only the standard knowledge on the program and teaching methods. They wanted to re-design their website and add a way for people to search for and contact music teachers in your region. We wanted to make the ability to find a teacher a primary goal for users and have the content-heavy pages be easier to digest and navigate.</p>

			              <h1>The Solution</h1>
			              <p>Working with Strategist, our team created a whole ecosystem portal around Teachers, Students and Parents. The website would allow you to log online, search and book a music teacher for one or multiple children and then allow for ongoing communication during the semester. Users were presented with a dashboard after loging in that would display the key information based on that day and what lesson their child had been registered for. Having music teachers on each end of the world, we wanted to bring forward the most relevant content forward for users.</p>

			              <h1>Personalization</h1>
			              <p>Each teacher had their own profile page for users to review. This was easily editable by the teachers so they could put their own content and specific details around the courses they teach. In designing the UI, I kept a large focus on the Booking feature and making contact and location information easily accessible on the side for returning users. The image slider bar was optional but allowed teachers to showcase the space and activities they would giving lessons in.</p>
