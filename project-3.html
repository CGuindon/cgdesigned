			              <h1>The Challenge</h1>
			              <p>MYC original website was strictly informative, giving users only the standard knowledge on the program and teaching methods. They wanted to re-design their website and add a way for people to search for and contact music teachers in your region. We wanted to make the ability to find a teacher a primary goal for users and have the content-heavy pages be easier to digest and navigate.</p>

			              <h1>Creating an Ecosystem</h1>
			              <p>Working with Strategist, our team created a whole ecosystem portal around Teachers, Students and Parents. The website would allow you to log online, search and book a music teacher for one or multiple children and then allow for ongoing communication during the semester. Users were presented with a dashboard after logging in that would display the key information based on that day and what lesson their child had been registered for. Having music teachers on each end of the world, we wanted to bring forward the most relevant content forward for users. Different views for Parents and Teachers.</p>

			              <h1>Personalization for Teachers</h1>
			              <p>Each teacher had their own profile page for users to review. This was easily editable by the teachers so they could put their own content and specific details around the courses they teach. In designing the UI, I kept a large focus on the Booking feature and making contact and location information easily accessible on the side for returning users. The image slider bar was optional but allowed teachers to showcase the space and activities they would giving lessons in. Creating Courses is easy to do and manage existing classes.

			              <h1>Generating New Business</h1>
			              <p>From a brand perspective, the identity felt outdated and very content heavy. We wanted to appeal to a new generation or parents with a focus on clean easy to read information but still create a family friendly fun environment for parents to feel at home. We wanted to show the MYC flavour through the brand. The colours and elements were chosen based on the foundations of music. Music is very mathematical and has an order and structure but thereâ€™s also a lot of freedom and spontaneity with creative freedom in playing and creating music. The base of MYC is built on the foundation of teaching the music foundations on the piano. For the brand I wanted to blend structure with creativity and give a nod to the piano instrument. The bright coloured bars all have the same height but vary in width and colour. Blending the illusion of piano keys being played with purpose but fluidly and in patterns as well. We made use of large imagery and light rounded icons to showcase the fun side of learning music at MYC.</p>
			              <p>The website pages used the colours and shapes through a series of re-usable blocks for content and call to actions making it feasible for the development stage as well. Establishing a style guide to follow and creating component blocks versus designing every page to save time and making any future or new pages easy to create.</p>
