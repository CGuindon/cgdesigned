          <h1>Music to My Ears</h1>
          <p>
            Music for Young Children have provided the best quality music
            education to young children for 39 years, spanning 3 continents
            across the globe. In order to provide more than 900 teachers and
            24,000 students annually with the best service, MYC chose bv02 to
            modernize their registration process and redefine the curriculum's
            process.

        <h2>Starting Point</h2>
        <p>
          The current registration process was being done manually by the head
          office. Users would contact MYC staff to be paired with a teacher in
          their local area. After registration, teachers would then need to
          manage all communications with students or parents by email throughout
          the course of the program. Our goals were to increase the amount of
          teachers under the MYC umbrella and attract new parent registrations.
          We proposed to re-design the MYC website that would include a new user
          portal and partnering app. With the overhaul of new digital products,
          we put forward a new brand and identity. Below you'll find the
          original logo and website.

        <h2>Find a Teacher</h2>
        <p>
          Our new user portal allowed teachers to create a public profile that
          would display their local area and what courses they offered. Having
          this data set enabled the website to support a new feature that would
          let parents easily find and review potential teachers. Once found,
          parents could then continue through the full registration flow online
          — making the process much quicker and easier.

        <h2>Creating an Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>
          Each new user would get access to the MYC portal through the website
          and mobile app. Both the needs of parents and teachers needed to be
          addressed in the portal while keeping development efforts minimal to
          hit our scheduled deadline. The user interface was designed using
          reusable components and layout templates that could be easily modified
          to fit each user type’s need. Our portal dashboard kept the same
          responsive layout for both teachers and parents but displayed key
          information for each. We used this approach for the entire website and
          app structure.

        <h2>Personalization</h2>
        <p>
          Teachers had their own public profile page that included a description
          about themselves, prices and specific details about the courses they
          offered. Each teacher could log into the portal to edit, manage and
          communicate their current programs and students, as well as, add new
          course times.

        <h2>Retaining Users</h2>
        <p>
          The parent portal became an integral tool in fostering and retaining
          users; giving quicker access to see the schedules for any ongoing
          courses, allowing multiple children under one parent account and
          making teachers and course information more accessible.

        <h2>Bright, Shiny & Scalable</h2>
        <p>
          The new brand was created with a new generation of parents in mind.
          The new identity needed to focus on clean and easily digestible
          information but also show off the family fun MYC flavour. The colours
          and elements were inspired by the balance of structure and freedom
          within music. Music is very mathematical with order and structure but
          there’s also a lot of freedom and spontaneity involved on the creative
          side. Another key component of the MYC program is that all of the
          foundation lessons are taught on the piano.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result was a pattern of rectangle bars all the same height but
          varying lengths and colours — blending piano keys, structure and
          freedom. Throughout the website and app, the style made use of large
          imagery and light rounded icons to showcase the fun atmosphere of an
          MYC lesson. To contrast with the rectangles, all buttons and links on
          the website and app use circles and lozenges as differentiators. The
          brand’s colours and shapes are seen within the re-usable components,
          created for content sections and call to action blocks making it more
          efficient for the development team.
