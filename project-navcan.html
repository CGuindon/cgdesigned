          <h1>NAV CANADA Take Charge Website</h1>
          <p>
            NAV CANADA is responsible for managing Canadaâ€™s airspace, and as
            such, the selection process for a career in air traffic services is
            highly competitive. They needed a new brand and website to attract
            the best candidates to apply through their career's website, Take
            Charge. My role as the senior visual designer was to create a new
            visual direction and produce all visual deliverables for the
            website. In the process, I also created a matching infographic to be
            used by their marketing team.
