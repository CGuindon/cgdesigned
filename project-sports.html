					<h1>Touch Down</h1>
					<p>With an aggressive cross-platform strategy in place, a national sports league chose You.i TV to design and develops an improved, personalized experience for their video streaming app starting with Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV. The goal was to have the same user experience running across all platforms. My role as senior designer was to create and lead the interaction and visual design for the project.</p>

				<h2>Starting Base</h2>
				<p> The national sports league provides both linear (Live TV) and non-linear (VOD) video content. The suite of content includes mainly post games with some live games, television series, short clips and live broadcasted channels. They shared results and data from previous research conducted and their current analytics. We opted to run some of our own stakeholder interviews, user surveys and competitive analysis.</p>

				<p>They wanted to maintain consistency within their digital products but had no specifications for Television platforms. Our visual designs needed to match the brand for their mobile app but be adapted and expanded for TV screens and elements.</p>

				<h2>Preliminary POC</h2>
				<p>Before kicking off the official project, we completed a small demo app delivered as a proof of concept to validate our tech. This project was more of a vision piece with tighter deadlines and very flexible requirements. The project was a great starting point to validate and iterate some of our initial ideas. We took what we learned and expanded the ideas into the official project.</p>

				<h2>Goals, Requirements and Challenges</h2>
				<p>The key business goals were to increase minutes watched, number of visits, app stability and paid Game Pass subscriptions (full access to their premium content). They had a large amount of free shorter video clips and strict limitations with the live content (especially games) due to broadcasting rights and locations. The authentication system was very complex due to varying methods of login and multiple levels of locked content. We had a tight deadline for launch which meant keeping development efforts minimal for the first version.</p>

				<h2>The Solution</h2>
							<p>After an on-site discovery design sprint, rapid prototyping and user testing, we choose to surface the free content that was available to all users with the option to auto-play. We divided the content into categories which became the top level sections of the app. We then designed a user experience going through 3 key screens: the menu, the player and the deep dive. This structure could be re-used for each section of the app.</p>
							
							<p>We started with high level user flows, then designed key screens as wireframes that would be used in an interactive prototype for testing. We repeated this process throughout the project, continuously iterating and improving our idea. Some of my initial deliverables were detailed annotated wireframes, clickable prototypes, extensive user flow diagrams and button mapping specifications.</p>

					<h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>
					<p>The menu has 3 panel sections with first level navigation items, 2nd level navigation items and a preview video. The preview auto-plays video based on the 1st level navigation item selected and users can scroll through the second navigation items to make a selection. In the game’s section we created a dynamic list order that brings live games to the top, places pre-games in the middle and pushes post-games to the bottom. The list items refresh each time the user enters this section. The key was to surface the most popular content first, even if that changed based on the current day and time.</p>

					<p>The deep dive screen is an extension of the player and can be accessed by navigating down from the player controls. The video shrinks down to the top right corner and the score bar data updates in real time. This deep dive allows users to browse extra content related to the video without missing any moments from the game.</p>

						<h2>Flexible Templates</h2>
						<p>The 3 key screens were designed to be re-used for each type of content without changing the core interactions or user flows. The base skeleton remains the same while each individual element may vary in design to best suit the content’s needs. We worked closely with the development team throughout the entire process, ensuring efficiency and quality for the final product.</p>

				<h2>Results & Post-Launch</h2>
				<p>Analytics from our new app showed:</p>
					<ul class="storypoint-list">
						<li><strong>Twice</strong> as many users now authenticate.</li>
						<li><strong>65% longer</strong> average time using the app.</li>
						<li><strong>27% higher</strong> video conversion rate.</li>
						<li>Increased Game Pass Landing Page visits and Game Pass minutes watched.</li>
					</ul>	
				<p>We continued to work towards future releases that would include user experience improvements and new features. One of those new features was to introduce sponsorship opportunities within the app. Using our current design layout, we selected and identified specific components within our design system that could dynamically insert advertisements at strategic times. These advertisements could be easily updated by the client without new development efforts each time.</p>
