          <h1>Touch Down</h1>
          <p>
            With an aggressive cross-platform strategy in place, a national
            sports league chose You.i TV to design and develops an improved,
            personalized experience for their video streaming app starting with
            Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV. The goal was to have the same user
            experience running across all platforms. My role as senior designer
            was to create and lead the interaction and visual design for the
            project.

        <h2>Starting Point</h2>
        <p>
          The national sports league provides both linear (Live TV) and
          non-linear (VOD) video content. The suite of content includes mainly
          post games with some live games, television series, short clips and
          live broadcasted channels. They shared results and data from previous
          research conducted and their current analytics. We opted to run some
          of our own stakeholder interviews, user surveys and competitive
          analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
          They wanted to maintain consistency within their digital products but
          had no specifications for Television platforms. Our visual designs
          needed to match the brand for their mobile app but be adapted and
          expanded for TV screens and elements.

        <h2>Preliminary POC</h2>
        <p>
          Before kicking off the official project, we completed a small demo app
          delivered as a proof of concept to validate our tech. This project was
          more of a vision piece with tighter deadlines and very flexible
          requirements. The project was a great starting point to validate and
          iterate some of our initial ideas. We took what we learned and
          expanded the ideas into the official project.

        <h2>Requirements and Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          The key business goals were to increase minutes watched, number of
          visits, app stability and paid Game Pass subscriptions (full access to
          their premium content). They had a large amount of free shorter video
          clips and strict limitations with the live content (especially games)
          due to broadcasting rights and locations. The authentication system
          was very complex due to varying methods of login and multiple levels
          of locked content. We had a tight deadline for launch which meant
          keeping development efforts minimal for the first version.

        <h2>Base Foundation</h2>
        <p>
          After running a discovery session and design sprint with the client's
          product team, we decided to make more of their free content available
          to all users. Unauthenticated users, could still access a game's
          highlights along with news about the league or specific team. We
          organized all content (free and premium) into digestible categories
          &mdash; this became the top-level navigation of the app. Each category
          followed the same user flow through 3 key screens and actions: browse
          the menu, watch in the player and discover more in the deep dive.
        </p>

        <p>
          My design process started with high level user flows, before creating
          wireframes for key screens that could be used in an interactive
          prototype for testing. The process was repeated throughout the project
          lifecycle, continuously iterating and improving ideas. Some of my
          initial deliverables were detailed annotated wireframes, clickable
          prototypes, extensive user flow diagrams and button mapping
          specifications.

    <div class="sports-bg-white">
      <div class="grid-2 storypoint">
        <h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>
        <p>
          Our main landing pages displayed a video window that would auto-play
          each section's free content. This combined with the 2 level
          collapsible navigation for quick and simple browsing, allowed users to
          get to the content they wanted faster. We also programmed logic within
          each section to surface the most relevant videos first based on
          location and time of use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without missing a moment, users can discover other related content by
          navigating down from the player controls. When in this deep dive
          screen, the video player shrinks down to the top right corner and a
          live score bar is displayed.

        <h2>Flexible Templates</h2>
        <p>
          The 3 key screens were designed to be re-used for each type of content
          without changing the core interactions or user flows. The base
          foundation remains the same while each individual element may vary in
          design to best suit the contentâ€™s needs. We worked closely with the
          development team throughout the entire process, ensuring efficiency
          and quality for the final product.

        <h2>Results & Post-Launch</h2>
        <p>Analytics from our new app showed:</p>
        <ul class="storypoint-list">
          <li><strong>Twice</strong> as many users now authenticate.</li>
          <li><strong>65% longer</strong> average time using the app.</li>
          <li><strong>27% higher</strong> video conversion rate.</li>
          <li>
            Increased Game Pass Landing Page visits and Game Pass minutes
            watched.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We continued to work towards future releases that included
          improvements to the current experience, as well as, new features. One
          of those new features was to introduce sponsorship opportunities
          within the app. Using our current design layout, we selected and
          identified specific components within our design system that could
          dynamically insert advertisements at strategic times. These
          advertisements could be easily updated by the client without extra
          development efforts each time.
