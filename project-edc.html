          <h1>EDC Data Visualization Website</h1>
          <p>
            Export Development Canada (EDC) is Canada’s export credit agency.
            Their job is to support and develop Canada’s export trade by helping
            Canadian companies respond to international business opportunities.
            They were going through a large-scale transformation that would have
            significant impact on the employee’s day-to-day tasks. They wanted
            to build an internal micro-website to help give information to what
            this transformation meant. My role on this project was as a senior
            web designer (interaction and visual).

        <h2>Starting Base</h2>
        <p>
          We hosted the client’s team and led a full day workshop to determine
          the main requirements for the website. Only a small portion of the
          content had been written to start. Our workshop results would help
          establish direction and context for the rest of the content. On the
          visual side, our only mandate was to use EDC’s primary brand colours —
          blue and white.
        </p>

        <p>
          After doing an assessment of the EDC brand, I opted to keep the same
          font used on their current website and retain the icon style used in
          previous internal communications. New icons were created and added to
          the existing set.

        <h2>Goals, Requirements and Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          The micro-website would be used as a communication tool before and
          during the transformation. The changes in the transformation would
          impact their technology, their people, their processes and their
          information. The level and specifics of the impact for each change
          would vary depending on the role of the employee. We knew there was
          going to be a large amount of content across the entire website but
          only a small segment would be relevant to a single user.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the biggest challenges was trying to surface the right
          information to the right user. We divided our target users, all EDC
          employees, into two key personas — lower level employee and a
          management level. Our primary user, the lower level employee, would
          only need to access a small subset of information. Our secondary user,
          the manager, would be looking for multiple subsets under their
          department.
        </p>

        <p>
          We decided to funnel the content based on the employee’s role. We
          wanted to show an overview of all the changes that would impact a
          single employee. Each change would have a greater or smaller level of
          impact depending on the employee’s role. Each change would have
          detailed information on how it specifically impacted a role. These
          factors became the focus of our design decisions.

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Finding and reading the impact details needed to be easy and
          attractive to users. We pushed to make this communication tool more
          interactive and visual than a standard content website. Most of the
          content would be very dry and technical, we wanted to keep employees
          engaged so they could better understand the changes coming to their
          company. We first established how we would visualize the level of
          impact for all changes. This would be the main screen and entry point
          into all detailed content.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through whiteboard sketches, user flows and rapid prototyping, I
          designed some initial wireframe concepts for the main screen. The
          content would be categorized into five types and then filtered by
          role.

        <h2>Bringing it all together</h2>
        <p>
          We created an initial landing page to help navigate the user to their
          optimal starting point. On first launch, users would be asked to
          select their role’s department and then choose a type of change. Each
          department and type had a global statement for how the transformation
          would impact that team as a whole.

          Based on the selections made, users would enter the main interactive
          screen showing the relevant graph. Each circle represented a change.
          The size of the circle would be used as a visual indication for the
          level of impact for that change — the larger the circle, the bigger
          the impact. Circles were placed on a horizontal line that corresponded
          with one of four categories. The four categories remained consistent
          for all five types of change. The amount of circles within each
          category would differ from role to role. The screen would be
          dynamically built to adapt the amount and size of each circle per role
          and change type.

          Users could get on overall view on the amount of changes and levels of
          impact within each category. We added hover states to the circles that
          would allow users to see a short title for that change. If a circle
          was selected, a side panel would slide open with more details about
          that change. The detailed content was divided into 3 tabs that
          explained what the change was, how EDC would help and who else would
          be effected. Once a user had selected and opened a change circle, the
          state of the circle shape would update from showing a fill to a
          stroke, allowing the user to keep track of their progress.

        <h2>Flexible Templates</h2>
        <p>
          The graph would repeat across all five change types. Users could
          navigate to any other type by using the tabbed menu bar at the top. We
          added a role selection menu on the side so that managers could easily
          switch views between different role. The department’s global statement
          was also available as an overlay from this selection menu.

        <h2>Responsive</h2>
        <p>
          The information from this communication tool would be primarily read
          during work hours from the office desktop computers. However, we
          wanted to support a way for the information to be available remotely
          on mobile phones. We adapted the graph layout design to function on
          handheld devices while retaining its dynamic flexibility. Users can
          open and collapse each category to see all their change points. The
          circles are still sized accordingly to show the level of impact. Users
          can tap a change list item to enter the details view.
