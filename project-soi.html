            <h1>Student's on Ice Foundation Website</h1>
            <h4>
              Internationally recognized as a pioneer and leader in Polar
              Education, SOI offers unique educational expeditions to the
              Antarctic. Our team was tasked with re-designing their website
              including adding a brand new section of alumni stories. My role as
              senior designer was to create a new visual direction for the
              foundation's website and produce all visual deliverables. My role
              as interaction designer was to assist our strategists in research
              and information architecture, as well as, defining the user
              interface.
