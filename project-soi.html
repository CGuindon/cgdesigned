          <h1>Student's on Ice Foundation Website</h1>
          <p>
            Internationally recognized as a pioneer and leader in Polar
            Education, SOI offers unique educational expeditions to the
            Antarctic. We did a re-design of the website that included
            re-organizing the information architecture, creating re-usable page
            templates in the CMS and building a new section for alumni stories.
            My role as the senior designer was to create a new visual direction
            for the foundation's website and produce all visual deliverables. I
            also assisted our strategists in research for the information
            architecture, as well as, defining the user flows and interface.
